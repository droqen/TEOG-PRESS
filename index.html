hello writer or thing maker!
i'm droqen, i also make things.

i have written to you because i have the idea that you
might like to write about or make a thing about my videogame
which would be great for me, since i'd like people to know about it.

it's coming out when the flower moon is full.
(May 12, ~1PM EST if a midday release is allowable by Steam)

here are some quotes
from people who have told me that my new video game
<strong><em>The End of Gameplay</em></strong> is good and/or affected them:
</pre>
<p class="quote" style="width:440px; margin-left: 2em;">
	"its really beautiful and polished and intentional. The levels are really nice to just look at, like the craftsmanship is really really high and it is a beautiful thing . . . Imagine you make pottery and mugs for a living and then one day you make a mug that is just all handles just to show off that you can"
</p>
<p class="quote" style="width:440px; margin-left: 2em;">
	"I'm in complete awe of what you have achieved here, <strong>I honestly don't know how you did it or how making something like this can be done.</strong> I'm confused, moved, inspired and made uncomfortable at the same time. . . . It gave me lots of new ideas and new feelings about games, about art."

here is a poem:
</pre>
<pre class="stanza" style="font-style: italic; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; color: #444; margin: 5em;">
if gameplay dies and makes its way home
to where does gameplay go?
living or dead where gameplay's soul flies
to sages in caves, to gardens and wells,
to bottomless oceans clipped blue,



there like a white-winged bird returning
home where it knows to go
to the last checkpoint gameplay touched:
i want to to know where do you go when you die!

does gameplay have save slots
like <span style="text-decoration:line-through">a stranger</span> a child on the bus alone
gameplay safe in gameplay's world
wrapped up in itself left right



am i gameplay?
mortal if gameplay is mortal
even touched by the pen of death
whose inkwell is wet
still from writing all those names
in the wastelands far away
in the hospitals i know
in caves



will gameplay's pen write my name when i die?
