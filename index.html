		<h1>Press Website for The End of Gameplay.</h1>
		<p>
Hello! You are probably a writer, or a video-maker, or game-maker
(or someone who otherwise in some way talks about games publicly)
who I think might be interested in talking about my new videogame
<em>"<strong>The End of Gameplay</strong>."</em>
		</p>
		<p>
Before I get into the main text, let me introduce myself! I'm droqen,
I made & released a game called Starseed Pilgrim 12-13-ish years ago,
I've been thinking about games my whole life and I make lots of little games.
		</p>
		<h1>Intention of this page</h1>
		<p>
I have a lot of feelings about The End of Gameplay.
I think that it is, by far, the most beautiful and affective work that I have ever made in my entire life so far.
This press page is my very best attempt to convey what makes it beautiful and interesting,
ultimately to get it out there, to ensure that the right people hear about it.
		</p>
		<p>
Thank you.
		</p>
		<p>
Oh, and please don't share the link to this page publicly.

<h1>Some quotes from early players (friends and internet-acquaintances, strangers)</h1>
		<p class="quote">
			"I found the game to be joyous, sad, funny and inspiring through different sequences, even mystical in a way."
		</p>
		<p class="quote">
			"this really struck a chord with me . . . it really has me in a mood now, 50% on the way to maybe having some tears, that kind of chord"
		</p>
		<p class="quote">
			"its really beautiful and polished and intentional. The levels are really nice to just look at, like the craftsmanship is really really high and it is a beautiful thing . . . Imagine you make pottery and mugs for a living and then one day you make <strong>a mug that is just all handles just to show off that you can</strong> . . . I think there is a way to interpret that as a bad thing but I am thinking of it in very high regard"
		</p>
		<p class="quote">
			"I'm in complete awe of what you have achieved here, <strong>I honestly don't know how you did it or how making something like this can be done.</strong> I'm confused, moved, inspired and made uncomfortable at the same time. . . . It gave me lots of new ideas and new feelings about games, about art."
		</p>
		<h1>What is <em>the form</em> of The End of Gameplay</h1>
		<p>
Have you ever read a collection of short stories or poems by a single author,
or I guess listened to an album where the order of things probably matters,
and some people revere that order and other people just pick their favourite song and jump to it?
		</p>
		<p>
I really wanted to make a game that has that free shape.
So I have occasionally described The End of Gameplay as a platformer-poetry anthology,
but I don't like that name for it.
It has plain sort of presentation, a menu, and each menu item leads to a singular game-poem-like thing.
		</p>
		<p>
They are modeled after a collection of games that I made and called "droqevers,"
little prototypes, sketches, drafts, some full of gameplay and some only poetic.
They are gone now, but each such "droqever" was a short little sometimes-poetic game,
and another way that I like to describe The End of Gameplay is "a bunch of droqevers glued together."
(But, just to be clear, none of them have been re-used, all of the pieces of TEOG are new work.)
Almost all of the "droqevers" were platformers.
		</p>
		<h2>What is <em>the content</em> of The End of Gameplay</h2>
		<p>
Hello, who even made this! It's me, droqen, the "creator/poet" of Starseed Pilgrim.
		</p>
		<p>
It has been thirteen years now since the release of Starseed Pilgrim
<em>(if you round up and go by the original release date, not the Steam release date)</em>
and I've had a lot of angsts about what it is that games are in those years.
And in recent months, I started to catch and get ahold of those angsts in this most sticky phrase,
<strong><em>"kill gameplay."</em></strong>
		</p>
		<p>
I tried to write about it in a properly descriptive way after it was clear that a significant number of
friends and peers and acquaintances and total strangers wanted to know what the hell I meant by that.
However, I instantly knew that I was not capable, so I began channeling my energy instead into this videogame.
		</p>
		<p>
One of the levels/poems, just one of them, is about appreciating the walls of my bedroom,
how my partner painted them this really nice seafomy blue-green colour while I was away one year and I came back to this totally new room,
and it became a sort of metaphor for something, appreciating some boundaries in life, 'walls',
but it's all very smushed around and hard to describe in words.
It's basically a poem with some jumping around and progression and secrets.
		</p>
		<p>
Another one of the very first levels/poems is a pretty straightforward metaphor for
the feeling of being born into gameplay-like structures like capitalism,
never knowing anything else and only imagining.
